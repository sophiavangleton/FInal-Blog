I want to do this to account for a possible speed-accuracy tradeoff, where as you get faster in a task you may be less accurate. This is important to account for because it is not the tradeoff we are interested in testing and want to check that this is not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterpretation\r\nWe see that error rate does change from no-switch to switch trials, where no-switch trials seem to lead to lower average error rates by subject, and vice versa for switch trials. We see an outlier in the no-switch trial where one subject had unusually high error rates when completing no-switch trials which may be skewing the plot higher in overall error rate for the no-switch trial type. This is what we expect to see according to previous undersanding of trial type and error rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, when looking at the trends for each respective effect, we see things that make sense. Congruent trials, or trials were the task instruction (size or parity) does not matter, should be lower in average response time than incongruity which is what we see. Furthermore, we see that no-switch congruence leads to the shortest response times and switch incongruity (size and task instruction does matter) leads to the longest response times.\r\nCue Stimulus Interval\r\nSimilarly to the congruence interaction plot, we see that between the short and long CSIâ€™s there is little to no interaction effect. HOWEVER we find a suprising result: We see when CSI is long (meaning long preparation), response times are lower on average in both no-switch and switch conditions. This is suprising because longer preparation would induce more cognitive stability (theoretically) and thus lead to a longer switch cost (seen in reaction time) than short CSI. This may be some evidence toward a anti-tradeoff model being represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
